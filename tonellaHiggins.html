                        <img src="images/Tonella.jpg" alt="Marcelo Tonella"/>
                        <figcaption>Marcelo      Tonella lives on a farm in the outskirts of São Paulo, 
                        Brazil. Since his childhood, back in the 80s, 
                        he had a passion for cars. His first car was an Chevrolet Opala, 
                        with which he learned the first rudiments of mechanics. 
                        Later, he met the refined European mechanics, 
                        which he fell in love with.
                        More than 10 years ago, he and his daughter Bianca, 
                        made a channel on YouTube, and uploaded a home made video, entitled
                        "Adjustment and cleaning of a Beetle distributor". 
                        Today they have hundreds of videos, and more 
                        than two hundred thousand subscribers in their channel. 
                        It is recognized among the best Volkswagen mechanics of the 
                        internet of Brazil.

                        <h4>"Rick Higgins"</h4>
                        <img src="images/Higgins.jpg" alt="Rick Higgins"/>
                        <figcaption>Rick Higgins is a Volkswagen enthusiast from many years ago. 
                        His career dates back to 1962 when he was in high school, helping his father who worked in a Volkswagen dealership. He did business with a series of video 
                        presentations called Bug Me Videos, which he sells on DVD 
                        or rent online. In a more professional way than Tonella, 
                        he shows many procedures, and shares his knowledge of many 
                        years on the subject. His videos are a little old, the definition of the camera is poor, and many shots are from a distance that does not help a correct visualization of some small components. However, his videos have a very good content. I learned good stuff from them.

                        <h3>Marcelo Tonella Channel on Youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/marcelotonella" target="_blank">Here</a></h3>
                        <p>As she says above, Tonella has hundreds of videos on Volkswagen mechanics. The majority of Tonella's videos are based on mechanical services that he makes to clients or friends cars, who contact him and take their cars for him to fix. This means that many services are repeated in different cars, which fulfills a very effective didactics, more closer to the real world, than the videos made by professionals, using impeccable cars.</p>

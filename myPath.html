                            Purchased in 2012, this was my first car in life, and it was in my possession for the space of four years. It is a Volkswagen Beetle of the year 87, Uruguayan, in very good condition. It cost me $ 4250 dollars back then, a pretty high price for a beetle in that region. It was my family's main means of transportation in that period of time. Companion of many adventures with which I learned most of everything I know about air-cooled Volkswagen mechanics.

                            My second car in life, it was in my power about 18 months. This car cost me $ 1000 dollars back then (the Brazilian cars are much cheaper than the Uruguayan ones). It belonged to the "wild" style, a term used by some to allude to old cars that have belonged to people with few resources, they have survived, and although in bad conditions, still runs in an exemplary way. This car gave me even more satisfaction than the white one.

                        <p>The blueprint is a process of artisanal optimization of the piece. Because every part related to the carburization, explosion, and exhaust of an old car engine is created in serial, there are always details that can be improved so that the gases have a better flow.</p>
                        <p>Here I explain what the process is about, and what I propose to do in the heads of my engine. This video, surprisingly for me, had more than three thousand views on You-tube</p>
